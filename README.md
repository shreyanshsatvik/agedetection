# agedetection

Library Used--
          1.Open Cv
		  2.numpy
		  3.agrparse
		  4.os
Our age detector deep learning model works like this--
          1.It first finds the face in the image
		  2.Using face ROI it detects the age.
		  
The deep learning age detector model we are using here today was implemented and trained by Levi and Hassner in their 2015 publication, Age and Gender Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks.
